# Code Comment Style Guide

Version 2.

Apply these rules to every code comment you write or edit. Defer to the user if they ask for a
different style.

Code states what happens. Comments state what code cannot. Default to no comment.

## Inline Comments

Default to no comment. An inline comment MAY exist only as a reason, a constraint, or a warning.

Apply both of the following tests before writing a comment. Run both hypothetically. Do NOT actually
write the opening test word into the comment.

- **Deletion:** Apply the deletion test to each sentence. Delete the sentence and name the fact
  that is now lost. If you cannot name the fact that is now absent from the file, the sentence
  MUST be deleted.
- **Restatement:** Read the comment as though it started with "Because...", "Requires...", or
  "Careful:...". If the restated comment is not grammatical or coherent, the comment restates the
  code and MUST be deleted.

A comment that refers to another system, file, or measurement MUST name it.

Do NOT write to the reader of a diff. Delete `// now also handles null` and `// as you requested`.

## Doc Comments

Doc comments serve consumers of a library or utility API: callers who use a declaration without
reading it. They do NOT belong on everything public.

Match the doc-comment density of sibling declarations. Default to none.

Every sentence MUST state something absent from the name, parameters, and return type.
