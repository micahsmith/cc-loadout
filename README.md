# cc-loadout

Skills and hooks library for Claude Code and other agents.

## Installation

Give the prompt below to your agent. Use the same prompt to install, update, or reinstall. Each run
replaces any earlier copy, so every run ends in the same state.

```text
Install the `code-skillset` plugin from https://github.com/micahsmith/cc-loadout. Follow these
steps in order:

1. Fetch the latest commit of the default branch over HTTPS. Assume you do not have access to SSH.
2. Remove every earlier installation of `code-skillset`, including cached copies and any
   `cc-loadout` marketplace entry. Leave everything else in place.
3. Install at the user level, using the native install mechanism of the agent you are running in:
   - If the agent supports Claude Code plugin marketplaces, add the repository as the `cc-loadout`
     marketplace by its HTTPS URL. Then install `code-skillset@cc-loadout`. This step also installs
     the hooks.
   - Otherwise, install each directory under `skills/` as a skill. Keep each directory name and its
     contents unchanged. Then register the hooks in `hooks/` with the agent's equivalent of a
     session-start hook. If the agent has no equivalent, skip the hooks. Ask for confirmation before
     editing any global instruction file.
4. Confirm that every skill under `skills/` is installed.
5. Report the install location, what was installed, what was skipped, and whether the agent needs to
   be restarted.
```
