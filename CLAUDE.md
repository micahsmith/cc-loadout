## Overview

This repository holds two things:

- `skald`, a Rust command-line program. The crate is at the repository root: `Cargo.toml`, the
  program in `src/`, and integration tests in `tests/`.
- `code-skillset`, a plugin of skills and hooks for AI agents. The plugin is in `plugin/`. The
  marketplace manifest at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` points at it.

The full test suite is:

```sh
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

`skald dev seed --designs <N>` is a test-only command. It adds N data-model designs to the store
for the current repository, so that tests can measure the store at scale. It is hidden from
`--help`. It MUST NOT be used outside tests.

## Style

Skills and documentation are prose instructions intended for AI agents. Use the following guidance
for writing:

- Be clear. You MUST avoid excess jargon. Prefer simple and legible prose.
- Be concise. ONLY add words in service of clarity; cut out any other excess.
- Use RFC directives in skills and documentation. The modality of an instruction MUST be
  expressed using all capital terms like 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'SHOULD', 'MAY', etc.

## Authoring Hooks

Hooks that ship as part of the plugin are located in `plugin/hooks`.

## Authoring Skills

- Each skill is located at `plugin/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Skills MAY use progressive disclosure
  in order to reduce complexity.
- Skills that write files MUST try to resolve save location using the same convention. These
  skills MUST use `mktemp` or a system temp directory ONLY inside a bundled script. Instructions
  on file path resolution MUST be duplicated inline for any skill that writes files. Any change to
  this convention MUST be synced across all skills. The order for resolving save location is as
  follows:
  1. an output-specific directory established by convention (e.g., if the repository has a `specs/`
     directory then specs MUST be written there)
  2. an existing scratch directory (e.g., `tmp/`, `temp/`, `scratch/`, especially if git-ignored)
  3. the repository root or the current working directory if not in a repository
